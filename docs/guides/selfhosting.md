# Selfhosting

Again, I would prefer you to not host this bot yourself, as there are a lot
of configurations to do. If you still want to proceed, follow the steps.

**Step 1**: Check your python version.

You need to check if your python is in one of the [supported python versions](#supported-python-versions)
Python 2.x WILL **NOT** BE SUPPORTED.
