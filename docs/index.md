## Waterbot Documentations
This site moved from [https://waterbot.gitbook.io/docs](https://waterbot.gitbook.io/docs) to here.

That site has been deprecated and the most updated documentations will be here instead.

Press ++f++ or ++s++ to search the docs.
## Selfhosting
I would prefer you to not host this bot yourself, as there are a lot
of configurations to do. Nevertheless the guide will be at [here](guides/selfhosting.md).

## Basic idea

This documentations contains information on how to use the commands, in a simple way.

!!! example "Legends"
    Parameters surrounded with square brackets (``[ ]``) are optional parameters 
    (i.e. ```.command_name [optional parameter]```)
